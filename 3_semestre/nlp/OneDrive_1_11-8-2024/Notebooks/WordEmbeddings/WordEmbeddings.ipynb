    "### Why Neural Networks for NLP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks have revolutionized NLP due to their ability to learn complex patterns and relationships in language data. Here's why they are particularly well-suited for NLP tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handling Sequential Data:** Text is inherently sequential, and neural networks, especially recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers, excel at processing sequential information. They can capture the dependencies and context between words in a sentence or document.\n",
    "2. **Learning Complex Representations:** Word embeddings, generated using neural network-based techniques like Word2Vec and GloVe, capture semantic relationships between words. These representations are far richer than traditional one-hot encodings, allowing neural networks to better understand the meaning of text.\n",
    "3. **Generalization:** Neural networks can generalize well to unseen data, making them robust for a wide range of NLP tasks. They learn underlying linguistic patterns that can be applied to new and diverse text inputs.\n",
    "4. **Adaptability:** Neural network architectures can be adapted and fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question answering. This flexibility makes them a powerful tool for various NLP applications.\n",
    "5. **Continuous Improvement:** With the availability of large datasets and advancements in deep learning techniques, neural networks continue to improve their performance on NLP tasks, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in natural language understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging the power of neural networks, we can develop sophisticated models that can effectively process, analyze, and generate human language. This has led to significant advancements in various NLP applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and text summarization tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on session, we'll explore how neural networks are used to create word embeddings and how these embeddings can be utilized for various downstream tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Word Embeddings?\n",
    "In NLP, word embeddings refers to the processo of transforming words into a mathematical format that neural networks can understand. In this hands-on session we will explore the pros and cons of the basic use of neural networks in NLP. This proces, lead the way to the modern LLM and trasformers architectures.\n",

    "Word embeddings leverage co-occurrence patterns to create dense, low-dimensional vectors that capture word relationships. This idea, known as Firth's Hypothesis (**\"You shall know a word by the company it keeps\"**__**), forms the foundation of distributed word embeddings. Co-occurence are also referred as n-grams, which are sequences of n words that appear together in a text. The co-occurrence matrix is a square matrix where the rows and columns represent words, and the cell values indicate how often two words appear together in a given context window. By analyzing these co-occurrence patterns, we can learn meaningful representations of words that capture their semantic relationships.\n",
