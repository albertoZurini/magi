Readme - An Extended Kalman Filter Based Battery SOC Estimation
---

During the course lectures, we will show how to make profitable use of MATLAB and some of its toolboxes to solve problems of performance analysis of dynamic systems, parametric estimation, identification of models from data, and prediction of the evolution of dynamic systems. 

The current live script illustrates a real-world application of the estimation and prediction techniques of the state variables of a dynamical system. These techniques will be learned during the course 267MI.

## Instructions

Steps to retrieve and run the live script:

- Download as a ZIP archive the whole contents of the folder named "***L0_EKB_based_Battery_SOC_Estimator***," available in the "***Class Materials***" file area of the MS Teams course team.
- Uncompress the archive into a preferred folder.
- Add the chosen folder and subfolders to the Matlab path.
- To start using the MATLAB live script, please open the previously chosen folder and select the subfolder named "***EKF_SOC_Estimation_v3.1***" as the working folder directly in MATLAB. Finally, open the live script named "***main.mlx***".

Work your way through the sections of this live script, using the links to navigate through the various addressed topics. You can also browse the live script as PDF or HTML document. Please pay attention: the PDF and the HTML version of a live script do not preserve the capability of inserting a MATLAB command or a piece of code directly in the live script, obtaining the result directly in the script itself.
