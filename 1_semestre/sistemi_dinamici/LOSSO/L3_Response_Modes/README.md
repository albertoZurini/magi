Readme - LTI Discrete-Time Systems: Response Modes
---

During the course lectures, we will show how to make profitable use of MATLAB and some of its toolboxes to solve problems of performance analysis of dynamic systems, parametric estimation, identification of models from data, and prediction of the evolution of dynamic systems. 

The "***LTI_movements_response_modes.mlx***" live script illustrates, by experimenting

- How to compute the response mode matrices using MATLAB, either in the scenario of all distinct eigenvalues, either in the case of multiple eigenvalues;

- How to proficiently solve either symbolic and numeric problems, involving the computation of the response modes using MATLAB. 


The live script named "***Hands_On_LTI_state_free_movement***" is focused on illustrating how chosiing the initial state as linear combination of the right eigenvectors of the matrix A can influence the state free mmovement.


Finally, the live script named "***Hands_On_LTIsys_ResponseModes_EXERCISES.mlx***" contains a few exercises. The sketches of the solutions are available in a few PDF documents in the folder "**handwritten_notes**" .



## Instructions

Steps to retrieve and run the live script:

- Download as a ZIP archive the whole contents of the folder named "***L3_Response_Modes***," available in the "***Class Materials***" file area of the MS Teams course team.
- Uncompress the archive into a preferred folder.
- Add the chosen folder and subfolders to the Matlab path.
- To start using the set of MATLAB live scripts, please select the previously chosen folder as the working folder directly in MATLAB and open the live script named "***LTI_movements_response_modes.mlx***".

Work your way through the sections of this live scripts, using the links to navigate through the various addressed topics. You can also browse the live script as PDF or HTML document. Please pay attention: the PDF and the HTML version of a live script do not preserve the capability of inserting a MATLAB command or a piece of code directly in the live script, obtaining the result directly in the script itself.
