Readme - MATLAB Intro live script collection
---

During the course lectures, we will show how to make profitable use of MATLAB and some of its toolboxes to solve problems of performance analysis of dynamic systems, parametric estimation, identification of models from data, and prediction of the evolution of dynamic systems. At the end of the course, you will be able (using MATLAB):

- To proficiently analyse the performance of dynamic systems in the discrete-time domain both in a deterministic and in a stochastic setting;
- To implement estimation, prediction, and identification algorithms using experimental data;
- To design and implement state estimation algorithms in a deterministic and stochastic framework.

## Instructions

Steps to retrieve and run the live script:

- Download as a ZIP archive the whole contents of the folder named "MATLAB_intro," available in the "Class Materials" file area of the MS Teams course team.
- Uncompress the archive into a preferred folder.
- Add the chosen folder and subfolders to the Matlab path.
- To start using the set of MATLAB live scripts, please select the subfolder named "live_script" as the working folder directly in MATLAB and open the live script named "*usingMATLAB_267MISystemDynamics*.mlx".

Work your way through the pages of this set of live scripts, using the links to navigate through the various addressed topics. It would be best if you did them in order initially, but you can return to any of them when you need to refresh your memory. You can also browse the live script collection as PDF or HTML documents. Please pay attention: the PDF and the HTML version of a live script do not preserve the capability of inserting a MATLAB command or a piece of code directly in the live script, obtaining the result directly in the script itself.

**Hint:**Â Have these live scripts open directly in MATLAB so you can quickly try all the examples as you work through the scripts.
